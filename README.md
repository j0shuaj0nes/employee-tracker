# Employee-tracker
A command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Description
This command-line application allows users to view all departments, roles and employees within a company database. Users can view employee salaries and different managers of departments. Users can add new departments, roles and employees into the database. They can also update the roles of existing employees. 
This app was built to help businesses or companies keep track of their employees, whom their managers are, and the salaries of all staff members. 

## Installation
Run 'npm i' in the integrated terminal to install necessary packages for this app. 

## Usage
The user opens the index.js file and then opens the integrated terminal. They then run 'node index' to start the app. The app then presents a list of option for the user to choose from: "View all departments", "View all roles", "View all employees", "Add a department", "Add a role", "Add an employee", "Update an employee role". The user selects their desired choice of action. Once an option is selected, the user follows the basic prompts to execute their enquiry.
